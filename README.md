# Machine-learning-Patteren-recognition-by-discrete-bayes-decision-rule
Discrete Bayesian decision rule is one of the foundation technique of machine learning for solving classification problems. We used discrete Bayes rule on a sufficiently large dataset with the fixed memory size constraint M and train a classifier. We improved the classifier by a few optimization techniques.
Running time for optimization: 73 hours.
Accuracy: 96.4%
